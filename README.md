# Olympic-Games

## Generalinfo
The Olympic Games is an internationally celebrated, multi-sports event that takes place every two years. Competition and comradery among countries is what attracts people to this event. In this project we plan to examine the important features of the Olympics and the effect their country's size and GDP has on their performance. This information could help the Olympic Coordinators predict how countries will do in future Olympics based on the population and GDP of their country.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* R Stuio: 4.1.3
* Rattle: 5.5.1
* Web scraping 

## Data 
* Years of Olympic History 
	* we used 
* Country Information 

## Analysis 
	
  
## Conclusion  
* First, athletes coming from countries of large population size are performing better at the Olympic games.
* Second, the better a country's economy is doing the higher they placed at the Olympic games for 2014 and 2016. 
* Third, the correlation between weight and height of athletes showed us that athletes who have won medals are more likely to have a high weight and height. 
* Finally, the summary table we created showed us that not all countries participate in every sporting event that is held at the Olympic Games. 

We suggest countries utilize this information to predict how they will do in future Olympic games. The countries can use this to determine how their current population and GDP will impact their performance. Since the size of the country has an influence on the performance of athletes, we also suggest setting different game groups for athletes coming from the different country size.
